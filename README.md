# Forms

This is a form API for clients and companies registration created for [Super Toldos](www.supertoldos.com.br)

This API should:
  * Safely register clients
  * Safely register companies
  * Preverse any sensitive data and protect it
  * Be used only with authorization under the company's rules




  

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
